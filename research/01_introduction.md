# Retool Custom Components

Retool custom components allow you to extend the functionality of your Retool applications by building your own components with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or React). This allows you to go beyond the standard set of Retool components and create highly tailored user interfaces and experiences.

## Two Approaches to Custom Components

It's important to be aware that there are two methods for creating custom components in Retool:

*   **Custom Component Libraries (Recommended):** This modern approach involves developing React components locally in your own development environment and then deploying them to your Retool instance. This method offers a more robust and scalable development workflow.

*   **Legacy Custom Components:** This older method involves writing HTML and JavaScript directly within a special `Custom Component` in the Retool editor. Retool no longer recommends this approach.

This research will focus on the recommended method: **Custom Component Libraries**.
